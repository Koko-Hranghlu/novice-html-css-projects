# Novice HTML & CSS Projects
A collection of few projects that reflect the kind of projects I first started to make when I had gain basic HTML and CSS skills. This projects is created out of nostalgia or just for reference purposes
# Reminder!
The list of projects in here doesn't follow the standardized rules and conventional way of creating websites. It means the source code or the way of designing these projects doesn't conform to the modern way of creating websites that meets and satisfy the needs and user-experience of the audience. Thanks!
